### Introduction 
Specify a set of rules that will be used for HL7 FHIR to define how to represent hospital discahrge messages in the Czech national context, in line with European eHN guidelines.

Its main objective is to define the content components and the preferred structure to be used to construct a hospital discharge report.The purpose of this standard is to define the representation of the discharge report as a patient's medical record for the purpose of electronic exchange of health information between individuals, healthcare providers and infrastructure in the Czech Republic. 

This includes both jurisdictional and cross-border scenarios.

This guide does not describe how to exchange this message.
